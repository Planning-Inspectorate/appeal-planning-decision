        When I view the horizon-api documentation
        Then I should see //adddocuments
        And I should see //createcase

        When I view the appeals-api documentation
        Then I should see GET //appeals

        And I should see DELETE //appeals//uuid
        And I should see PUT //appeals//uuid
