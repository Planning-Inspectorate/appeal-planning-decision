Feature: Appeal statement file submission

  I want to submit an appeal statement.
  An appeal may include an optional appeal statement file.
  Valid appeal statement files must:
  * be one of the white-listed types (doc, docx, pdf, tif, tiff, jpg, jpeg and png) and
  * not exceed a size limit.
  Appeal statements files that contain sensitive information are not permitted.
  The latest successfully uploaded appeal statement file replaces any previously uploaded file.

  Scenario Outline: Prospective appellant submits valid appeal statement file without sensitive information
    When user submits an appeal statement file <filename> confirming that it "does not" contain sensitive information
    Then user can see that the appeal statement file <filename> "is" submitted
    Examples:
      | filename                              |
      | "appeal-statement-valid.doc"          |
      | "appeal-statement-valid.docx"         |
      | "appeal-statement-valid.pdf"          |
      | "appeal-statement-valid.tif"          |
      | "appeal-statement-valid.tiff"         |
      | "appeal-statement-valid.jpg"          |
      | "appeal-statement-valid.jpeg"         |
