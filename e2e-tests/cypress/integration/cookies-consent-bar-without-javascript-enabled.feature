Feature: Cookie consent bar - no JS

  As a PO on the appeals service
  I need the cookie banner to cater for users who donâ€™t have JS enabled
  So that the service is compliant with the GDS standards

  @as-98 @as-98-1
  Scenario: Cookie banner always displays
    Given a user visits the site with JavaScript disabled
    When the user navigates through the service
    Then the cookie banner remains visible

#  @as-98 @as-98-2
#  Scenario: Cookie banner links to cookie settings page
#    Given a user visits the site with JavaScript disabled
#    When the user views the cookie preferences page
#    Then the cookies page is presented
