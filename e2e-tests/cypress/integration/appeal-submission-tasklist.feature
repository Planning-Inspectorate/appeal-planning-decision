Feature: Task lists
  As a prospective appellant I want to clearly see which sections of the
  appeal submission I have completed, so that I do not waste my time checking.

  Initially all the tasks are "NOT STARTED", once the appellant has provided required information they are "COMPLETED"
  Some tasks could be multi steps and if not all steps are completed, then the task is considered "IN PROGRESS"

  The "Check your answer" task state should be "CANNOT START YET" until all mandatory tasks are "COMPLETED"

  Scenario Outline: When the tasks are presented, then they should able to be selected
    Given the appeal tasks are presented
    And the task <task> is available to selection
    Examples:
      | task                                            |
      | "About you - Your details"                      |
      | "Planning application - Application number"     |
      | "Planning application - Upload application"     |
      | "Planning application - Upload decision letter" |

      | "Appeal site - Site access"                     |
      | "Appeal site - Site safety"                     |
