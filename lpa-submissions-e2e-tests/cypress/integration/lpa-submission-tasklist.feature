Feature: Task lists
  As a beta LPA I want to clearly see which sections of the
  appeal submission I have completed, so that I do not waste my time checking.

  All the tasks should be "NOT STARTED"
  
  The "Check your answer" task state should be "CANNOT START YET"

  Scenario Outline: When the tasks are presented, then user should be able to select them
    Given the lpa tasks are presented
    And the task <task> is available for selection
    Examples:
      | task                                                                              |
      | "About the appeal - Review accuracy of the appellant's submission"                |
      | "About the appeal - Do you have any extra conditions?"                            |
      | "About the appeal - Tell us about any appeals in the immediate area"              |
      | "About the appeal site - Tell us about the appeal site"                           |
      | "Required documents - Upload the plans used to reach the decision"                |
      | "Required documents - Upload the Planning Officer's report"                       |
      | "Optional supporting documents - Telling interested parties about the application"|
      | "Optional supporting documents - Representations from interested parties"         |
      | "Optional supporting documents - Notifying interested parties of the appeal"      |
      | "Optional supporting documents - Site notices"                                    |
      | "Optional supporting documents - Planning history"                                |
      | "Optional supporting documents - Statutory development plan policy"               |
      | "Optional supporting documents - Other relevant policies"                         |
      | "Optional supporting documents - Supplementary planning document extracts"        |
      | "Optional supporting documents - Development Plan Document or Neighbourhood Plan" |


  Scenario Outline: When the lpa questionnaire is not started, then the tasks are in "NOT STARTED" state
    Given the <task> part of the lpa questionnaire is not started
    When the lpa tasks are presented
    Then the state for <task> is displayed to be "NOT STARTED"
    And the state for "Before You submit - Check your answers" is displayed to be "CANNOT START YET"
    Examples:
      | task                                                                              |
      | "About the appeal - Review accuracy of the appellant's submission"                |
      | "About the appeal - Do you have any extra conditions?"                            |
      | "About the appeal - Tell us about any appeals in the immediate area"              |
      | "About the appeal site - Tell us about the appeal site"                           |

      | "Optional supporting documents - Planning history"                                |
      | "Optional supporting documents - Statutory development plan policy"               |
      | "Optional supporting documents - Other relevant policies"                         |
