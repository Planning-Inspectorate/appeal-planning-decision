Feature: Appeals Extra Conditions
  As a beta LPA I want to inform the Planning Inspectorate of any extra conditions I wish to be attached to the appeal decision (over and above the standard ones)
  So that the Inspector can decide whether or not to attach them to their decision.

  Background:
    Given an appeal has been created
    And a questionnaire has been created

  Scenario: AC01 - User navigates to 'Do you have extra conditions' page
    Given a LPA Planning Officer is reviewing their LPA Questionnaire task list
    When the user selects the link 'Do you have any extra conditions?'
    Then the user is presented with the 'Do you have any extra conditions?' page
    And the Page title is 'Do you have any extra conditions? - Appeal Questionnaire - Appeal a householder planning decision - GOV.UK'

  Scenario: AC02 - User makes no selection and is provided an error
    Given user is in the extra conditions page
    When user does not select an option
    And user selects Save and Continue
    Then user is shown an error message "Select yes if you have extra conditions"

  Scenario: AC03 - User selects no and proceeds to task list
    Given user is in the extra conditions page
    When user selects the option 'No'
    And user selects Save and Continue
    Then progress is made to the task list
    And a Completed status is populated for the task

  Scenario Outline: AC04 - user selects yes and provides further information in text field and proceeds to task list
    Given user is in the extra conditions page
    And user selects the option 'Yes'
    And user enters '<extra_information>'
    When user selects Save and Continue
    Then progress is made to the task list
    And a Completed status is populated for the task
    Examples:
