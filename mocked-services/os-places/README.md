# OS Places

Simplified mock of the OS Places API

Full OS Places [documentation](https://apidocs.os.uk/docs/os-places-postcode)
available online.

**NB.** This is a simplified API that exists purely for local development 
purposes. It's purposefully missing pagination data and place data that's
not likely to be needed in the project - only contains `ADDRESS`, `BUILDING_NUMBER`,
`THOROUGHFARE_NAME`, `DEPENDENT_LOCALITY`, `POST_TOWN` and `POSTCODE`. This
should be enough to get a place.
