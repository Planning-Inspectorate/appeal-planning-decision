# User Role
#
# Users are limited in what they can do. They are able to
# have read access to most things, but have no access to secrets
# (except listing).
#
# This is designed to be given to anyone who is a developer on the
# application. For the most part, this will enable them to read logs
# and make sure that things have deployed correctly.
