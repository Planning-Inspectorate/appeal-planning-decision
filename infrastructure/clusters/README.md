# Clusters

These describe the clusters that exist in the Azure infrastructure

## Terraform Variable Files

> New clusters will need to be added to the `jobs.provision.strategy.matrix`

These are Terraform variable files (`<environment>.tfvars`) that work with the
environment infrastructure in `/infrastructure/environments`. These are designed
to represent one cluster per file - nominally, we're expecting to have 
`dev.tfvars`, `staging.tfvars` and `prod.tfvars` but there are no constraints on 
naming convention.

Variables in these files should be defined as key/value pairs, eg:
```hcl
location = "eastus"
```
