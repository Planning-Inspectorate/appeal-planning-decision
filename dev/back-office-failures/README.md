# Submission failures helper

- dump the submission table failures into a json file in data folder, do not commit this (gitignored)
- ensure this matches with the dataFilename in index.mjs
- run the script
- should provide a list of failures ordered by date
- copy result to a csv file where the resolution can be tracked
