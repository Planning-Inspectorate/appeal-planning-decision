        <p>Upload an appeal statement (also known as a 'grounds for appeal') that explains why you think the local
          planning department's decision was incorrect.</p>
        <p>It should respond to the local planning department's reasons for refusal (these can be found on the decision
          letter), and include any other information that supports your appeal.</p>
        <p>If you refer to any documents in your appeal statement, for example photographs, you can upload them in the

            <p>When you appeal, the Planning Inspectorate looks at whether the local planning department correctly
              applied the relevant planning policies to your original planning application.</p>
            <p>You should set out why you think the local planning department's decision was incorrect in an appeal
              statement (also called a ‘grounds of appeal’). It should respond to the local planning department's
              reasons for refusal, which can be found on the local planning department's decision notice.</p>
            <p>If you think there is other relevant information that supports your appeal, this is the opportunity to
              highlight it to the Planning Inspectorate.</p>
            <h2 class="govuk-heading-s">Reasons for refusal</h2>
            <p>The first step is to read the local planning department's decision notice, where they list their reasons
              for refusing the planning application. Each reason for refusal will mention the planning policy the local
              planning department based their decision on. If you think the local planning department's reason for
              refusal is incorrect, list your evidence in your statement.</p>
            <p><strong>For example:</strong> the local planning department refused your application on the grounds of
              the proposal’s detrimental effect on the neighbours, but you have checked the relevant planning policy and
              do not think this is correct according to your measurements.</p>
            <h2 class="govuk-heading-s">Details of other relevant applications/appeals</h2>
            <p>If there are other appeals being considered for the same site, or similar proposals or appeals for sites
              in the local area, and they support your appeal, you should list them in your grounds of appeal. If
              possible, identify them on a street map with their addresses.</p>
            <p><strong>For example:</strong> your neighbour appealed a refusal for a similar proposal and was
              successful.</p>
            <h2 class="govuk-heading-s">Supporting documents</h2>
            <p>You will be able to upload any documents that you think support your appeal – this could be photographs
              of the site in relation to its neighbours, for example. If you plan to upload any supporting documents,
              you should refer to them in your appeal statement and explain why they are relevant.</p>
            <h2 class="govuk-heading-s">Responding to comments from interested parties</h2>
            <p>There may have been comments (also called ‘representations’) from interested parties on the original
              planning application. If you think these unreasonably influenced the local planning department to refuse
              your planning application, refer to them here and explain why you do not think they are relevant.</p>
            <p><strong>For example:</strong> interested parties commented on the planning application that the proposal
              would affect the character of the local area, but other nearby properties have had similar proposals
              approved.</p>
