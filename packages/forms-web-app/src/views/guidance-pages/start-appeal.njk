  <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Start your appeal</h2>

  <p>You'll need certain documents to complete your appeal:</p>

  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>your planning application form</li>
    <li>the decision letter from your local planning department</li>
    <li>your appeal statement</li>
  </ul>

  <p>If you do not have a copy of your planning application form, you can search for it on your local planning department's website.​</p>
  <p>You'll also need an email address. We will use this to contact you about your appeal.</p>

  <h2>Your appeal statement</h2>
  <p>This is the only opportunity to appeal your planning decision.</p>
  <p>You’ll need to write and upload a statement during the appeal process that explains why you think the local planning department's decision is incorrect. You'll need to respond to all the reasons for refusal (listed on the decision letter), and include any other information that supports your appeal.</p>

  {% set writeStatement %}
    <p>When you appeal, the Planning Inspectorate looks at whether the local planning department (also referred to as 'Local Planning Authority' or 'LPA') correctly applied the relevant planning policies to your original planning application.</p>
    <p>The decision will be based on the local planning department's development plan, which can be found on the local planning department's website.</p>
    <p>When deciding whether a planning application is in line with the development plan, they may have taken into account some or all of the following:</p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>the possible impact on the surrounding area</li>
      <li>the proposed use of the development</li>
      <li>the number, size, layout, position and external appearance of buildings</li>
      <li>the infrastructure available (for example, roads) and proposed means of access</li>
      <li>landscaping requirements</li>
    </ul>

    <p>You should set out why you are appealing the decision in your appeal statement (also called 'grounds of appeal'). It should respond to the local planning department's reasons for refusal, which can be found on the decision letter.</p>
    <p>If you think there is other relevant information that supports your appeal, this is the opportunity to highlight it to the Planning Inspectorate.</p>

    <h3>Reasons for refusal</h3>
    <p>The first step is to read the local planning department's decision letter, where they list their reasons for refusing the planning application. Each reason for refusal will mention the planning policy their decision is based on, and may also refer to additional planning documents.</p>
    <p>You should also read the planning officer's report, and any planning committee meeting notes (if applicable). If you think the local planning department's decision to refuse your application is incorrect, explain why in your statement.</p>

    <h3>Supporting documents</h3>
    <p>If you refer to any documents, for example photographs, in your appeal statement you need to explain why you think they are relevant in your statement and then upload them in the next step.</p>

    <h3>Responding to comments from interested parties</h3>
    <p>There may have been comments (also called 'representations from interested parties') on the original planning application. You can respond to them in your appeal statement if you want to.</p>
  {% endset %}

  {{ govukDetails({
    summaryText: "How to write your appeal statement",
    html: writeStatement
  }) }}

  <p>Your statement cannot include any sensitive information.</p>

  {% set sensitiveInformation %}
    <h3>Use of language and sensitive information</h3>
    <p>You should not use racist, inflammatory or abusive language, or include sensitive information ( also called 'special category information') in your statement. If you do, you will be asked to resubmit and this will delay your appeal (or invalidate it, if you do not resubmit in time).</p>
    <p>Sensitive information refers to:</p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>comments from children</li>
      <li>information relating to children
      <li>information relating to health</li>
      <li>information relating to crime</li>
    </ul>

    <p>It also refers to any information relating to an individual's:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>race</li>
      <li>ethnic origin</li>
      <li>politics</li>
      <li>religion</li>
      <li>trade union membership</li>
      <li>genetics</li>
      <li>physical characteristics</li>
      <li>sex life</li>
      <li>sexual orientation</li>
    </ul>
  {% endset %}
