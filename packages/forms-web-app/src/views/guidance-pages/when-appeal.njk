  <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">When you can appeal</h2>

  <p>You can appeal a householder planning decision from your local planning department if you think all their reasons for refusing your planning application are incorrect.</p>

  <p>The appeal must be in the same name as the planning application. If you applied on behalf of a business or organisation, the appeal should be in the name of that organisation.​</p>

  {% set inset %}
    <p>There is a different process to appeal:</p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/appeal-planning-decision" target="_blank">full planning decision</a></li>
      <li>a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/appeal-listed-building-consent-decision" target="_blank">listed building appeal</a></li>
      <li>a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/appeal-high-hedges-decision" target="_blank">high hedges decision</a></li>
      <li>a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/appeal-decision-about-tree-order/how-to-appeal" target="_blank">tree preservation consent order decision</a></li>
      <li>an <a href="https://www.gov.uk/appeal-enforcement-notice" target="_blank">enforcement notice.</a></li>
    </ul>
  {% endset %}

  {{ govukInsetText({
    html: inset
  }) }}

  <h3>Deadline for appealing​</h3>

  <p>You must appeal within 12 weeks of the decision date on the letter from your local planning department.</p>

  <p>The deadline is earlier if you’ve received an <a href="https://www.gov.uk/appeal-enforcement-notice" target="_blank">enforcement notice</a> for the same, or very similar, development. In which case must appeal within 28 days of the notice through <a href="https://www.gov.uk/appeal-householder-planning-decision/how-to-appeal" target="_blank">the main appeals service</a>.</p>
