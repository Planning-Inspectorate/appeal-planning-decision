# Database

We use a Cosmos DB instance historically for data, and are migrating to Azure SQL. The API uses both for now.

## SQL

For SQL we use [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) as an ORM. The schema is in this folder: [schema.prisma](./schema.prisma).

### Comments

Prisma schemas support comments, please add them to any models and fields/columns to explain the purpose and any important context. Comments that are only relevant in the context of the schema should start with `//`, comments that are relevant to users of the model should use `///`. Comments with `///` will end up in the generated type definitions, which is useful for users of the models. See https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-schema#comments.

### IDs

We use GUIDs for IDs (see https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/data-types/uniqueidentifier-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver16) this is because these IDs may be used in URLs and it makes them harder to guess. While we don't rely on that for security, it adds an extra layer. While not everything needs this, it is easier to make them all consistent and the increase in size (vs int) is negligible.

To add a model with a GUID ID field, use:

`@id @default(dbgenerated("newid()")) @db.UniqueIdentifier`

The meanings of these tags are:
* `@id` - this is an ID field (PRIMARY KEY)
* `@default(dbgenerated("newid()"))` - the default value is the native `newid()` function
* `@db.UniqueIdentifier` - the field type is a specific string type, UniqueIdentifier (see https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/api-reference/prisma-schema-reference#microsoft-sql-server)

### Conventions

We follow Prisma's suggested conventions, see [naming-conventions](https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/api-reference/prisma-schema-reference#naming-conventions). At a high-level:

* Model names should use PascalCase, e.g. `AppealUser`
* Column names should use camelCase, e.g. `AppealUser.serviceUserId`
* Relation names should use PascalCase, e.g. `AppealUser.SecurityToken`

### Strings

The default `String` type in Prisma is `nvarchar(1000)` in MSSQL. Use a more specific type if you need a larger (or smaller) string, by adding an `@db.` attribute, such as `@db.NVarChar(2000)`. See [prisma-schema-reference#microsoft-sql-server](https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/api-reference/prisma-schema-reference#microsoft-sql-server).
