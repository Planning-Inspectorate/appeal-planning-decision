  You have created a new function which uses Node.js 12 (TLS) and the OpenFaaS
  of-watchdog which gives greater control over HTTP responses.

  npm i --save can be used to add third-party packages like request or cheerio
  npm documentation: https://docs.npmjs.com/

  Unit tests are run at build time via "npm run", edit package.json to specify
  how you want to execute them.

  TypeScript support is also available out of the both and this can be built for
  multiple different processor architectures by setting the ARCH build argument.
  To configure your Docker instance for multiarch emulation, run this command:

    docker run --rm --privileged multiarch/qemu-user-static --reset -p yes
